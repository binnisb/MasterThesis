I would also like to thank David Sumpter and the Collective Behaviour Group at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University, for giving me the opportunity to write about this subject.

Finally, I would like to thank all the staff at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University for the countless number of interesting lectures I have received and appreciated during the past three years.
